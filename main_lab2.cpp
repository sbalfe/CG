 * to continue using/developing forever more. However, I ask that you don't
 * share the code or your derivitive versions publicly. In order to continue
 * to be used for coursework and in particular assessment it's important that
 * versions containing solutions are not searchable on the web or easy to
 * download.
 *
 * If you want to show off your programming ability, instead of releasing
 * the code, consider generating an incredible image and explaining how you
 * produced it.

/* This is the entry point function for the program you need to create for lab two.
 * You should not need to modify this code.
 * It creates a framebuffer, loads an triangle mesh object,
 * calls the drawing function to render the object and then outputs the framebuffer as a ppm file.
 *
 * Required c++ files are: main_lab2.cpp framebuffer.cpp linedrawer.cpp polymesh_object.cpp hit.cpp
 *
 * This will produce an image file called test.ppm. You can convert this a png file for viewing using
 *
 * pnmtopng test.ppm > test.png
 *
 * You are expected to fill in the missing code in polymesh.cpp.
