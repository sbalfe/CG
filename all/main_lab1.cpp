 * I've put a lot of time and effort into this code. For the last decade
 * it's been used to introduce hundreds of students at multiple universities
 * to raytracing. It forms the basis of your coursework but you are free
 * to continue using/developing forever more. However, I ask that you don't
 * share the code or your derivitive versions publicly. In order to continue
 * to be used for coursework and in particular assessment it's important that
 * versions containing solutions are not searchable on the web or easy to
 * download.
 *
 * If you want to show off your programming ability, instead of releasing
 * the code, consider generating an incredible image and explaining how you
 * produced it.
 */

/* This is the entry point function for the program you need to create for lab one.
 * You should not need to modify this code.
 * It creates a framebuffer, calls the drawing function and then outputs the framebuffer as a ppm file.
 *

 * Required c++ files are: main_lab1.cpp framebuffer.cpp linedrawer.cpp
 *
 * This will produce an image file called test.ppm. You can convert this a png file for viewing using
 *
 * pnmtopng test.ppm > test.png
 *
 * You are expected to replace the line drawing function with one that only uses integers and no floats.
